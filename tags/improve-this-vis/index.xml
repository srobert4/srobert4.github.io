      <description>It’s not often I see a cool data project focused on Australia, and in particular Australian politics, so I was especially excited to see freerangestats’ exploration of the 2016 Australian Election Study featured in RWeekly this week! The RWeekly email included this visualization, showing the responses to 6 questions about Australia’s parliamentary system, organized by party preference for Senate in the 2013 Federal Election.
At first, I was excited to see where voters for my party came in relative to other voters in parliamentary trivia, but then… how can I even compare?</description>
