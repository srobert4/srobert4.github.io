      <description>I am a fourth-year undergraduate student at Stanford University, majoring Mathematical and Computational Science. I am broadly interested in applications of data science to human-centered problems, which has led me to research positions involving software development and statistical analysis in the Stanford Brain Interfacing Lab, the Stanford Cardiovascular Biomechanics Computation Lab, and most recently the Stanford Computational Policy Lab. Following my graduation in June 2019, I will continue exploring similar research as I pursue my Ph.</description>
