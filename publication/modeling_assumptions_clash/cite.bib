abstract = { Across the United States, a growing number of school districts are turning to matching
algorithms to assign students to public schools. The designers of these algorithms
aimed to promote values such as transparency, equity, and community in the process.
However, school districts have encountered practical challenges in their deployment.
In fact, San Francisco Unified School District voted to stop using and completely
redesign their student assignment algorithm because it was frustrating for families
and it was not promoting educational equity in practice. We analyze this system using
a Value Sensitive Design approach and find that one reason values are not met in practice
is that the system relies on modeling assumptions about familiesâ€™ priorities, constraints,
and goals that clash with the real world. These assumptions overlook the complex barriers
to ideal participation that many families face, particularly because of socioeconomic
inequalities. We argue that direct, ongoing engagement with stakeholders is central
to aligning algorithmic values with real world conditions. In doing so we must broaden
how we evaluate algorithms while recognizing the limitations of purely algorithmic
solutions in addressing complex socio-political problems.},
