      <description>Background
SimVascular is an open-source software project partly based in the Stanford Cardiovascular Biomechanics Computation Lab, where I spent the Summer of 2018 with support from the Stanford Bioengineering REU program. SimVascular enables segmentation of medical image data to develop 3-dimensional cardiovascular models, which can then be used for patient-specific simulation and analysis of bloodflow.
Overview
My summer project involved developing a GUI plug-in for the software that would allow researchers to rapidly prototype and run simulations on lumped parameter models of the cardiovascular system.</description>

      <description>LiCoRICE is an open-source, realtime computation platform specialized for systems neuroscience experimentation. It has been developed in the Brain Interfacing Lab is now the system used to run the group&amp;rsquo;s closed-loop brain interface experiments. The platform is written in C and Python, and is specifically designed with a modular architecture to allow easy prototyping of models by experimenters using only Python.
I joined the LiCoRICE project in the Summer of 2017.</description>

      <description>Students in Data Challenge Lab, the data science intensive course taught by Bill Behrman and Hadley Wickham, pursue a quarter-long data exploration and analysis project of their choice using the Tidyverse R skills they learn in the course. My project explored the dataset released by the Stanford Education Data Archive along with the publication The Geography of Racial/Ethic Test Score Gaps, (Reardon, Kalogrides and Shores, 2017). Using a number of creative data visualization techniques, including some inspired by the New York Times interactive based on the paper, I was able to explore the education achievement gap between students of different races and with parents of different income and education levels geographically, by subject and by student age.</description>

      <description>In the Fall of 2018, I worked with the researchers at the Stanford Open Policing Project (OPP) in the Stanford Computational Policy Lab, to implement and run the Veil of Darkness Test, as proposed by Grogger &amp;amp; Ridgeway in 2006 using the large OPP dataset. The premise of the test is that the race of a driver is less visible to the police when it is dark outside than when it is light.</description>
