The dataset we were given to explore contains global aid exchanges between 47 countries across the world across the years 1973-2013. The goal is to create visualizations that answers the broad question: Who Donates?, as well as some bonus questions about distribution of donations geographically, temporally and by purpose of donation. Here’s my initial attempt! Along with some code. (The only package I use here is tidyverse).\nThe Data The data provided is nice and clean, so all we are left to do is read it in using read_csv(). I changed some variable names to make it nicer to work with, and noticed that there are a few negative quantities of money in the data, which I drop since they are impossible.

Sure, there’s plenty of sappy stuff about coming of age and figuring out what I want to start doing with my life (spoiler: haven’t figured it out), but what about concrete knowledge I’ve gained from my classes. Being the data nerd that I am, I decided to take a “data-driven” approach to this question, and see what I could find.

Although I played around with trying to scrape my transcript, it proved not worth the effort with all the Stanford security, so I created a Google Sheets document and manually recorded each class I have taken, including the department code e.g. “CS”, the course code e.g. “106A”, the school e.g. “School of Engineering”, the number of units I took the class for, and the quarter I took the class (recorded as an integer from 1-12).\nThen I was able to use the googlesheets package to pull this data into R with only a few lines of code:\n# Log in to Google gs_auth(new_user = TRUE) # Find the document we want sheet_key \u0026lt;- gs_ls() %\u0026gt;% filter(sheet_title == \u0026quot;courses\u0026quot;) %\u0026gt;% pull(sheet_key) # Read the document df \u0026lt;- gs_key(sheet_key) %\u0026gt;% gs_read() To avoid authentication over and over, I saved the resulting dataframe, and we’ll use the saved version.\nclasses \u0026lt;- read_rds(FILE.googlesheets) head(classes) %\u0026gt;% knitr::kable()   dept code school units quarter    esf 6a Office of Vice Provost for Undergraduate Education 7 1  lawgen 116n Law School 3 1  math 51 School of Humanities \u0026amp; Sciences 5 1  cs 106a School of engineering 5 2  physics 41 School of Humanities \u0026amp; Sciences 4 2  physics 41a School of Humanities \u0026amp; Sciences 1 2    Let’s clean up the formatting a little first.

For now, though all we want is the description to join to the datafram of my classes, and maybe the title of the classes might be fun too. To join to our dataset we need to split the num variable into department and code. While we’re at it, let’s drop any prerequisites from the desc variable.

Why do we spend billions of dollars exploring space? What can modern policymakers, entrepreneurs, and industrialists do to help us achieve our goals beyond planet Earth? Whether it is the object of exploration, science, civilization, or conquest, few domains have captured the imagination of a species like space. This course is an introduction to space policy issues, with an emphasis on the modern United States. We will present a historical overview of space programs from all around the world, and then spend the last five weeks discussing present policy issues, through lectures and guest speakers from NASA, the Department of Defense, new and legacy space industry companies, and more. Students will present on one issue that piques their interest, selecting from various domains including commercial concerns, military questions, and geopolitical considerations.

A concern is that the matching of dept and code isn’t working due to a formatting quirk.

The code in this section is adapted from this awesome blog post by Juan Orduz analyzing tweet data.\nLet’s start with something easy and classic, a wordcloud! For this we can use the packages tidytext to help with counting words, and wordcloud for visualization.\nclasses_with_descriptions %\u0026gt;% unnest_tokens(word, desc) %\u0026gt;% anti_join(get_stopwords()) %\u0026gt;% mutate(word = str_extract(word, \u0026quot;[:alpha:]+\u0026quot;)) %\u0026gt;% count(word) %\u0026gt;% arrange(desc(n)) %\u0026gt;% with( wordcloud( word, n, min.freq = 5, random.order = FALSE, colors = brewer.pal(8, \u0026#39;Dark2\u0026#39;) ) ) ## Joining, by = \u0026quot;word\u0026quot; No surprises here! But it’s still fun to see my degree described in pretty colored words.\nWhat is perhaps most interesting to me is whether we can see relationships between topics in the course descriptions! For this, I used the igraph package to create a graph, and the networkD3 package for visualization with D3.\nFirst we use tidytext to count the bigrams, the pairs of words that occur next to each other, in the descriptions.\nword_bigrams \u0026lt;- classes_with_descriptions %\u0026gt;% unnest_tokens( input = desc, output = bigram, token = \u0026#39;ngrams\u0026#39;, n = 2 ) %\u0026gt;% filter(!is.na(bigram)) %\u0026gt;% separate(col = bigram, into = c(\u0026#39;word1\u0026#39;, \u0026#39;word2\u0026#39;), sep = \u0026#39; \u0026#39;) %\u0026gt;% select(word1, word2) bigram_count \u0026lt;- word_bigrams %\u0026gt;% count(word1, word2, sort = TRUE) Now we can create a graph object and use the base R (gasp) plot function to visualize the relationships between words. We use a threshold to include only bigrams that occur more times than the threshold. It turns out that 2 is a good threshold for this dataset.\nthreshold \u0026lt;- 2 network \u0026lt;- bigram_count %\u0026gt;% filter(n \u0026gt; threshold) %\u0026gt;% graph_from_data_frame(directed = FALSE) plot( network, vertex.size = 1, vertex.label.color = \u0026#39;black\u0026#39;, vertex.label.cex = 0.7, vertex.label.dist = 1, edge.color = \u0026#39;gray\u0026#39;, main = \u0026#39;Course Descriptions\u0026#39;, alpha = 50 ) Even restricting the graph to bigrams that occur at least 3 times, it’s still hard to really see the relationships here. Now’s when we use D3 to take this visualization to the next level. Since there’s so much more interaction possible with a D3 graph, we’ll lower the threshold to see a little more detail.\nthreshold \u0026lt;- 1 network \u0026lt;- bigram_count %\u0026gt;% filter(n

Hover over nodes to read the labels more clearly. Unsurprisingly, the words cluster around the three nodes: “and”, “the” and “of”, which makes it more difficult to see relationships between domain terms. It’s fun to look at the bigrams that aren’t part of the main connected component, like “machine learning”, “maxwell’s differential equations”, “health care” and “neural networks”.

SimVascular enables segmentation of medical image data to develop 3-dimensional cardiovascular models, which can then be used for patient-specific simulation and analysis of bloodflow.\nOverview\nMy summer project involved developing a GUI plug-in for the software that would allow researchers to rapidly prototype and run simulations on lumped parameter models of the cardiovascular system. Lumped parameter modelling uses electrical circuit diagrams as an analogy to the cardiovascular system, allowing analysis of fundamental quantities such as pressure and flow. These models are often used in early stages of model development, as the simulations are relatively computationally inexpensive. They are also often used to provide boundary conditions to more complex, 3-D models.\nMotivation\nUnder the current architecture, researchers had to manually derive the ODEs that governed their LPN models, and write custom simulation code. This was extremely tedious for large models. In order to use lumped parameter models as boundary conditions, researchers needed to edit FORTRAN code. My goal was to streamline this process by designing a simple drag-and-drop graphical user interface within SimVascular. This interface allows researchers to quickly and easily design models, run simulations, and visualize the results all within the easy-to-use plug-in.\nExecution\nThe simulator plug-in is written in C++ with Qt for easy integration into the existing SimVascular architecture. Promising future directions involve specialization of the simulator for cardiovascular modelling by including large components such as a Windkessel model or even a \u0026ldquo;heart model\u0026rdquo;, which are composed of multiple traditional electrical components.\n","date":1550217600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1550217600,"objectID":"af2721847a53710fddd7ffe75386e508","permalink":"/project/simvascular/","publishdate":"2019-02-15T00:00:00-08:00","relpermalink":"/project/simvascular/","section":"project","summary":"A plug-in widget for fast and easy lumped parameter modelling of the cardiovascular system in SimVascular.","tags":["cbcl","cardiovascular","software","simulation"],"title":"A SimVascular Plug-in","type":"project"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"LiCoRICE is an open-source, realtime computation platform specialized for systems neuroscience experimentation.

The premise of the test is that the race of a driver is less visible to the police when it is dark outside than when it is light. Therefore, in the presence of racial bias, there should be a greater disparity in the racial breakdown of drivers stopped during daylight hours than at night. There are a number of factors to control for, most critically time of day, location of the stop.\nMy responsibilities included:\n Finding states and cities for which the data had the necessary covariates for the test, e.g. driver race and stop location Developing raw data visualizations to provide context and intuition for regression models Implementing the test in R for a large dataset aggregated across cities and states Analysing the results of the visualizations and regression models and drawing conclusions about the existence of racial bias and the statistical strengths and limitations of the method  ","date":1550217600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1550217600,"objectID":"c09d41aeb416ace6ede28d4f13dd0ac5","permalink":"/project/opp/","publishdate":"2019-02-15T00:00:00-08:00","relpermalink":"/project/opp/","section":"project","summary":"Identifying racial bias in police traffic stop patterns across the United States.","tags":["rstats","statistics","data-science","data","bias","opp"],"title":"The Stanford Open Policing Project","type":"project"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":" In this tutorial, I\u0026rsquo;ll share my top 10 tips for getting started with Academic:\nTip 1 \u0026hellip;\nTip 2 \u0026hellip;\n","date":1536476400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1536476400,"objectID":"6a451186c775f5f0adb3a0416d0cb711","permalink":"/tutorial/example/","publishdate":"2018-09-09T00:00:00-07:00","relpermalink":"/tutorial/example/","section":"tutorial","summary":"In this tutorial, I\u0026rsquo;ll share my top 10 tips for getting started with Academic:\nTip 1 \u0026hellip;\nTip 2 \u0026hellip;","tags":null,"title":"Example Page","type":"docs"},{"authors":["Pavan Mehrotra*","Sabar Dasgupta*","Samantha Robertson","Paul Nuyujukian"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1523775600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1523775600,"objectID":"d0e261070d317dc32b385019c3562491","permalink":"/publication/licorice-one/","publishdate":"2018-04-15T00:00:00-07:00","relpermalink":"/publication/licorice-one/","section":"publication","summary":"Systems neuroscience studies involving in-vivo models often require realtime data processing. In these studies, many events must be monitored and processed quickly, including behavior of the subject (e.g., movement of a limb) or features of neural data (e.g., a neuron transmitting an action potential). Unfortunately, most realtime platforms are proprietary, require specific architectures, or are limited to low-level programming languages. Here we present a hardware-independent, open-source realtime computation platform that supports high-level programming. The resulting platform, LiCoRICE, can process on order 10e10 bits/sec of network data at 1 ms ticks with 18.2 µs jitter. It connects to various inputs and outputs (e.g., DIO, Ethernet, database logging, and analog line in/out) and minimizes reliance on custom device drivers by leveraging peripheral support via the Linux kernel. Its modular architecture supports model-based design for rapid prototyping with C and Python/Cython and can perform numerical operations via BLAS/LAPACKoptimized NumPy that is statically compiled via Numba’s pycc. LiCoRICE is not only suitable for systems neuroscience research, but also for applications requiring closed-loop realtime data processing from robotics and control systems to interactive applications and quantitative financial trading.","tags":["licorice","neuroscience","software","realtime"],"title":"An Open-Source Realtime Computation Platform","type":"publication"},{"authors":[],"categories":null,"content":" Click on the Slides button above to view the built-in slides feature.\n  Slides can be added in a few ways:\n Create slides using Academic\u0026rsquo;s Slides feature and link using url_slides parameter in the front matter of the talk file Upload an existing slide deck to static/ and link using url_slides parameter in the front matter of the talk file Embed your slides (e.g. Google Slides) or presentation video on this page using shortcodes.
