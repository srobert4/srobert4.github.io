abstract = {Systems neuroscience studies involving in-vivo models often require realtime data
processing. In these studies, many events must be monitored and processed quickly,
including behavior of the subject (e.g., movement of a limb) or features of neural
data (e.g., a neuron transmitting an action potential). Unfortunately, most realtime
platforms are proprietary, require specific architectures, or are limited to low-level
programming languages. Here we present a hardware-independent, open-source realtime
computation platform that supports high-level programming. The resulting platform,
LiCoRICE, can process on order 10e10 bits/sec of network data at 1&nbsp;ms ticks with 18.2&nbsp;µs
jitter. It connects to various inputs and outputs (e.g., DIO, Ethernet, database logging,
and analog line in/out) and minimizes reliance on custom device drivers by leveraging
peripheral support via the Linux kernel. Its modular architecture supports model-based
design for rapid prototyping with C and Python/Cython and can perform numerical operations
via BLAS/LAPACK-optimized NumPy that is statically compiled via Numba’s pycc. LiCoRICE
is not only suitable for systems neuroscience research, but also for applications
requiring closed-loop realtime data processing from robotics and control systems to
interactive applications and quantitative financial trading.},
